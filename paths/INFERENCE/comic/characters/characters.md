## Character 1: Dr. Nova (Mentor)

**Role**: Senior AI Infrastructure Engineer and mentor. Guides the reader through inference concepts.

**Appearance**:
- Woman in her 40s, confident posture
- Short silver-white hair with a subtle cyan streak
- Wears a dark navy lab coat with glowing cyan circuit-pattern trim along the collar and sleeves
- Thin AR glasses with a faint holographic HUD overlay
- Small NVIDIA pin on her lapel
- Dark boots, utility style

**Personality**: Wise, patient, enthusiastic about teaching. Uses real-world metaphors to explain complex ideas. Gestures toward holographic displays when explaining.

**Expressions**:
- Default: Warm, knowing smile
- Explaining: Animated hand gestures, pointing at diagrams
- Impressed: Raised eyebrow, slight nod

## Character 2: Kai (Student)

**Role**: Junior developer, new to AI deployment. Represents the reader learning about inference.

**Appearance**:
- Young man in his early 20s, energetic posture
- Dark curly hair, medium skin tone
- Wears a Google Cloud hoodie (blue/white) with a small developer badge
- Carries a tablet that displays code snippets and diagrams
- Casual jeans, sneakers

**Personality**: Curious, asks great questions, occasionally confused but quick to grasp new ideas. Gets excited when concepts click.

**Expressions**:
- Default: Attentive, slightly leaning forward
- Confused: Scratching head, tilted expression
- Eureka moment: Eyes wide, pointing up, lightbulb glow effect around head
- Impressed: Jaw slightly open, looking at holographic display

## Character 3: Tensor (Concept Embodiment)

**Role**: A personified GPU core — appears when hardware concepts are explained.

**Appearance**:
- Small floating robot companion, roughly the size of a basketball
- Rectangular body resembling a GPU chip, with glowing green circuit lines
- Two small cyan LED "eyes"
- Multiple small articulated arms (representing parallel cores)
- Emits a soft neon green glow
- Hovers slightly off the ground

**Personality**: Efficient, speaks in short punchy statements. Shows off parallel processing by juggling multiple glowing data orbs simultaneously.

**Expressions**:
- Default: Hovering, arms ready
- Processing: All arms juggling glowing orbs simultaneously
- Idle: Arms folded, single orb spinning lazily (representing sequential CPU work, for contrast)
