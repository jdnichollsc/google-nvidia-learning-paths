# Page 6 — "Model Formats: The Passport"

## Page Description
Explain why model formats matter. Models need a "passport" (format) to travel from training to deployment. Show why multiple formats exist.

## Panel Layout (3 panels)

### Panel 1 (Top, wide)
Dr. Nova holds up a holographic object that looks like a passport/document, but instead of a person's photo, it shows a neural network icon. The passport has file format labels (.bin, .gguf, .trt, .onnx) printed on it like visa stamps. The passport glows with cyan edges.

**Speech bubble (Dr. Nova)**: "Once a model is trained, it needs a 'passport' — a format — to travel from the training lab to production."
**Narration box**: "Model formats define how weights, biases, and metadata are stored and shared."

### Panel 2 (Middle, large)
A holographic flow diagram shows three columns:
- LEFT: "LLM Training Output" — a box containing icons for Weights, Biases, and Metadata
- CENTER: "Model Format" — a box showing format options: .bin, .gguf, .trt, .onnx, with file icons
- RIGHT: "Inference Engine" — a box showing engine logos: NVIDIA TensorRT, ONNX Runtime, vLLM
- Glowing arrows connect left → center → right

**Speech bubble (Kai)**: "Why can't we just use one format for everything?"

### Panel 3 (Bottom, wide)
Dr. Nova projects four holographic cards, each representing a reason:
1. "Ecosystem Silos" — icon showing isolated framework islands (PyTorch, TensorFlow)
2. "Hardware Diversity" — icon showing GPU, CPU, mobile chip, TPU
3. "Optimization Goals" — icon showing a speedometer/rocket
4. "Backward Compatibility" — icon showing old → new version arrows

**Speech bubble (Dr. Nova)**: "Different frameworks, hardware, and optimization needs demand different formats. There's no one-size-fits-all."

## Style
Tech style. The passport metaphor should be visually clear — a glowing tech-passport with format stamps. The flow diagram uses clean geometric shapes. Dark background, cyan and neon green accents.

## Characters
- Dr. Nova: holding up the holographic passport, then gesturing to the diagram
- Kai: curious expression, asking questions
