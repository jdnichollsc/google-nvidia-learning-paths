# Page 1 — "Two Phases of AI"

## Page Description
Introduction: Kai meets Dr. Nova and learns about the two fundamental phases of every AI model — Training and Inference.

## Panel Layout (3 panels)

### Panel 1 (Wide, top half of page)
Kai walks into Dr. Nova's futuristic AI lab. The room has dark walls with glowing grid lines on the floor. Multiple holographic displays float in the air showing a chatbot conversation interface. Dr. Nova turns to greet Kai.

**Speech bubble (Kai)**: "Dr. Nova, I've been using ChatGPT and LLMs all day... but I have no idea how they work behind the scenes."
**Speech bubble (Dr. Nova)**: "Great question, Kai! Every AI model has two phases: Training and Inference."

### Panel 2 (Left, bottom half)
A glowing holographic split-screen appears. The LEFT side shows a stylized brain icon absorbing streams of colorful data particles, with the label "TRAINING" in cyan. Small icons of images, text, and numbers flow into the brain.

**Narration box** (top of panel): "Training is when the model learns from data — adjusting its weights through millions of examples."
**Speech bubble (Dr. Nova)**: "Think of training as studying for an exam..."

### Panel 3 (Right, bottom half)
The RIGHT side of the split-screen shows the same brain icon, now glowing brighter and outputting prediction results — text responses, classifications, generated images. Label: "INFERENCE" in neon green.

**Speech bubble (Dr. Nova)**: "...and inference is taking the exam. The model applies what it learned."
**Speech bubble (Kai)** (eyes lighting up): "So inference is the part users actually interact with!"
