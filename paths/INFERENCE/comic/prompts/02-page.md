# Page 2 — "Training: The Full Loop"

## Page Description
Explain the training loop: forward pass, loss computation, backward pass, and weight updates — shown as a holographic 3D flowchart.

## Panel Layout (3 panels)

### Panel 1 (Wide, top third)
Dr. Nova waves her hand and activates a large 3D holographic flowchart that floats in the air between her and Kai. The diagram glows with cyan and blue light.

**Speech bubble (Dr. Nova)**: "Training has two key steps: a Forward Pass and a Backward Pass."

### Panel 2 (Large, center — takes up half the page)
The holographic training loop diagram is fully visible and detailed:
- A database icon labeled "Training Dataset" connects via a glowing arrow to a blue box labeled "Forward Pass"
- The Forward Pass outputs to a chart icon labeled "Predicted Insights"
- "Predicted Insights" and a database icon labeled "Ground Truth Labels" both connect to a gear icon labeled "Loss Computation"
- Loss Computation connects to a blue box labeled "Backward Pass"
- Backward Pass connects to a brain icon labeled "AI Network" with subtitle "*Weights Updated*"
- A looping arrow goes from AI Network back to Forward Pass, completing the cycle
- The Forward Pass and Backward Pass boxes glow bright blue (#4285F4)
- Arrows are white/cyan with animated flow particles

**Narration box**: "The forward pass makes predictions. The backward pass compares them to the truth, computes the error, and adjusts the weights."

### Panel 3 (Bottom strip)
Close-up of Kai's face, realization dawning — his eyes widen and a subtle glow effect surrounds his head (eureka moment).

**Speech bubble (Kai)**: "So the model keeps going around this loop, getting better each time?"
**Speech bubble (Dr. Nova)** (off-panel): "Exactly! But once training is done, inference is much simpler..."

## Style
Tech style. Focus on the holographic diagram as the centerpiece. Glowing cyan arrows, blue (#4285F4) process boxes, dark background. Circuit-pattern panel borders.

## Characters
- Dr. Nova: gesturing toward the holographic diagram
- Kai: watching with growing understanding
