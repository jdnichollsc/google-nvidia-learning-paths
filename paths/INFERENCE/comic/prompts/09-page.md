# Page 9 — "Percentiles: The Truth Behind Averages"

## Page Description
Show why averages are misleading and why percentiles (P50, P90, P99) reveal the true user experience. Use an emotional contrast to make the point stick.

## Panel Layout (3 panels)

### Panel 1 (Top, wide)
Dr. Nova points at a holographic bar chart showing a single bar: "Average Latency: 50ms". The bar glows green, looking great. Kai smiles, satisfied.

**Speech bubble (Kai)**: "Average latency is 50ms — that's great!"
**Speech bubble (Dr. Nova)** (with a knowing look): "Not so fast. Averages hide the truth."

### Panel 2 (Middle, large — takes up half the page)
Dr. Nova waves her hand and the single average bar EXPLODES into a full distribution histogram. The shape is a classic long-tail distribution:
- Most bars are short (fast responses, clustered on the left)
- But a long tail of tall bars extends far to the right (slow responses)
- Three glowing markers are placed on the distribution:
  - **P50** (green marker at 45ms): "The typical experience — half of users are faster than this"
  - **P90** (yellow marker at 200ms): "1 in 10 users waits THIS long"
  - **P99** (red marker at 800ms): "1 in 100 users gets STUCK here"
- The area under the tail is highlighted in red

**Narration box**: "Percentiles reveal the real distribution. P50 is the median. P90 and P99 show the worst-case experiences that averages hide."

### Panel 3 (Bottom)
Split view. LEFT: 9 happy user icons getting fast responses (green glow). RIGHT: 1 frustrated user icon (Kai imagining himself) staring at a loading spinner, arms crossed, while the number "800ms" looms above in red.

**Speech bubble (Kai)**: "So even if most users are happy, some are having a terrible time?"
**Speech bubble (Dr. Nova)**: "Exactly. P90 and P99 ensure fairness — no user should get stuck waiting."

## Style
Tech style. The distribution chart is the visual centerpiece — a holographic histogram with glowing markers. The contrast between happy users (green) and frustrated P99 user (red) drives the emotional point home. Dark background.

## Characters
- Dr. Nova: revealing the truth behind averages
- Kai: goes from satisfied → concerned → understanding
