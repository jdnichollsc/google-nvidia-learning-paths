# Page 4 — "Why GPUs?"

## Page Description
Introduce GPUs vs CPUs through a visual comparison. Tensor (the GPU mascot) demonstrates parallel processing while a tired CPU struggles with sequential operations.

## Panel Layout (4 panels)

### Panel 1 (Top, wide)
Tensor (the small floating GPU robot with glowing green circuit lines, cyan LED eyes, and multiple arms) zooms dramatically into the frame from the right. Next to Tensor is a contrasting CPU character — a single-armed, boxy chip robot that looks tired and overwhelmed.

**Speech bubble (Tensor)**: "I'm built for parallel processing! Thousands of cores working simultaneously!"
**Narration box**: "GPUs are hardware accelerators designed for massive mathematical operations."

### Panel 2 (Middle left)
The CPU character tries to juggle glowing data orbs ONE at a time. It catches one, processes it slowly, then reaches for the next. Several orbs are on the ground, dropped. The CPU looks exhausted, sweat drops visible.

**Narration box**: "CPUs process data sequentially — one operation at a time."
**Speech bubble (CPU)**: "One... at... a... time..."

### Panel 3 (Middle right)
Tensor juggles HUNDREDS of glowing data orbs simultaneously with all its articulated arms, looking completely effortless. The orbs form beautiful parallel streams of light. Neon green trails follow each orb.

**Speech bubble (Tensor)**: "I handle thousands of matrix multiplications in parallel!"
**Narration box**: "GPUs with thousands of parallel cores multiply and add tensors at scale."

### Panel 4 (Bottom, wide)
Dr. Nova and Kai watch the GPU vs CPU demonstration from the side. Behind them, a visualization of a data center with rows of GPU racks glows in the background.

**Speech bubble (Dr. Nova)**: "Without GPU acceleration, modern LLMs wouldn't be practical. But raw power isn't enough — we need a structured pipeline."
**Speech bubble (Kai)**: "A pipeline?"

## Style
Tech style. High contrast between the struggling CPU (dim, single stream) and the thriving GPU (bright, parallel streams). Neon green and cyan particle effects for the parallel processing. Dark background.

## Characters
- Dr. Nova and Kai: observing from the bottom panel
- Tensor: energetic, showing off parallel processing
- CPU character: boxy, single-armed, tired (foil to Tensor)
