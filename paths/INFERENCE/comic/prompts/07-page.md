# Page 7 — "The Format Landscape"

## Page Description
Introduce the 4 main modern model formats: Safetensors, GGUF, TensorRT, and ONNX — each in its own panel with a distinctive visual metaphor.

## Panel Layout (5 panels — 2x2 grid + bottom strip)

### Panel 1 (Top left — Safetensors)
A glowing shield icon with the Safetensors logo at center. Around the shield: a lock symbol (security), a lightning bolt (speed), and the Hugging Face logo. Memory-mapped data streams flow safely through the shield.

**Label**: "SAFETENSORS"
**Narration box**: "Fast, secure. The default for sharing on Hugging Face. Prevents code execution on load."

### Panel 2 (Top right — GGUF)
A laptop sitting on a desk. On its screen, a small but powerful LLM is running (shown as a tiny glowing brain). Compression arrows squeeze a large model (big cloud) down into a compact file (small cube). The text "llama.cpp" glows on the terminal.

**Label**: "GGUF"
**Narration box**: "Compact, quantized. Powers 'LLMs on your laptop' with llama.cpp."

### Panel 3 (Bottom left — TensorRT)
A rocket engine icon blazing with NVIDIA green flames. The NVIDIA logo is prominent. Speed lines and flame effects suggest raw performance. A compiled engine file (.trt) sits at the core.

**Label**: "TENSORRT ENGINES"
**Narration box**: "Compiled for NVIDIA GPUs. Maximum performance, lowest latency."
**Speech bubble (Tensor)** (floating nearby, proud): "This is MY favorite!"

### Panel 4 (Bottom right — ONNX)
A glowing bridge structure connecting multiple floating islands. Each island represents a different framework: PyTorch island, TensorFlow island, OpenVINO island, ONNX Runtime island. The ONNX logo sits at the center of the bridge.

**Label**: "ONNX"
**Narration box**: "The universal bridge. Best for mixed-hardware environments."

### Panel 5 (Bottom strip, spanning full width)
Kai looks at his tablet, which displays a lifecycle table:
| Research → Framework-native | Sharing → Safetensors | Local → GGUF | Production → TensorRT/ONNX |

**Speech bubble (Kai)**: "The right format depends on where the model is in its lifecycle!"

## Style
Tech style. Each format panel has its own accent color (Safetensors: cyan shield, GGUF: warm green laptop, TensorRT: NVIDIA green rocket, ONNX: purple bridge). Dark backgrounds with glowing elements.

## Characters
- Tensor: appears in the TensorRT panel
- Kai: appears in the bottom strip with his tablet
