# Cover Page — Intro to Inference

## Page Description
The cover of a tech-style educational comic about AI inference on GPUs.

## Scene
A dramatic, cinematic composition. In the foreground, Dr. Nova (a woman in her 40s with short silver-white hair and a dark navy lab coat with glowing cyan circuit-pattern trim, wearing thin AR glasses) stands confidently on the left. Next to her, Kai (a young man in his early 20s with dark curly hair wearing a Google Cloud blue hoodie) looks up in awe. Between them floats Tensor, a small rectangular GPU-shaped robot companion with glowing green circuit lines and cyan LED eyes, juggling multiple glowing data orbs with its many small arms.

Behind them, a massive holographic GPU architecture fills the background — streams of light particles flow through a luminous inference pipeline visualization. The pipeline shows glowing nodes connected by neon beams representing data flow from input to output.

## Text Elements
- **Title** (large, bold, at the top): "INTRO TO INFERENCE"
- **Subtitle** (below title): "How to Run AI Models on a GPU"
- **Bottom tag**: "A Google Cloud x NVIDIA Learning Path"
- Google Cloud and NVIDIA logos appear subtly in the lower corners

## Style
- Tech style: precise geometric lines, circuit-pattern accents, glowing edge effects
- Color palette: deep blue (#1A365D) background fading to dark gray (#1A202C), cyan (#00D4FF) and neon green (#00FF88) highlights, electric purple (#805AD5) accents
- High contrast, cinematic lighting with volumetric glow effects
- 2:3 portrait aspect ratio
