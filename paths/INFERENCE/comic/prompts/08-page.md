# Page 8 — "Performance Metrics: What Really Matters"

## Page Description
Introduce the four key inference performance metrics: Total Latency, TTFT, ITL, and Throughput — each visualized with a clear metaphor.

## Panel Layout (5 panels)

### Panel 1 (Top, wide — establishing)
Dr. Nova and Kai stand in front of a massive holographic dashboard. Four metric panels glow on the dashboard, each waiting to be explored. Real-time numbers and graphs pulse with life.

**Speech bubble (Dr. Nova)**: "Let's talk about how we measure inference performance."
**Speech bubble (Kai)**: "Why do some AI apps feel instant while others lag?"

### Panel 2 (Left, upper middle — Total Latency)
A large stopwatch icon in the center. On the left, a user icon sends a chat message (glowing arrow out). On the right, the complete response arrives (glowing arrow in). The full time span is highlighted with a cyan bar labeled "Total Latency."

**Label**: "TOTAL LATENCY"
**Narration box**: "End-to-end response time — from request to complete answer."

### Panel 3 (Right, upper middle — TTFT)
A user sends a message. A brief pause. Then the very FIRST token ("The") appears with a dramatic flash/spark effect. A small timer shows the short duration.

**Label**: "TIME TO FIRST TOKEN (TTFT)"
**Narration box**: "How fast the first word appears. Critical for chatbots — makes the app feel alive."

### Panel 4 (Left, lower middle — ITL)
Tokens stream out one by one in a steady rhythmic flow, visualized as a heartbeat/EKG-style monitor line. Each peak represents a token being generated: "The" → "answer" → "is" → "forty" → "two". The rhythm is smooth and even.

**Label**: "INTER-TOKEN LATENCY (ITL)"
**Narration box**: "The rhythm of tokens after the first. Smooth flow = natural experience."

### Panel 5 (Right, lower middle — Throughput)
Multiple user icons (dozens) simultaneously send requests toward a central GPU server. A large meter/gauge shows "Requests/sec" climbing. Parallel streams of responses flow back to users.

**Label**: "THROUGHPUT"
**Narration box**: "How many requests or tokens per second the system can serve."

## Style
Tech style. Each metric has a distinct visual metaphor. The holographic dashboard ties them all together. Cyan and neon green for metric highlights. Dark background.

## Characters
- Dr. Nova: presenting the dashboard
- Kai: engaged, asking the opening question
