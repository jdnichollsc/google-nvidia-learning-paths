# Page 5 - Workflow Agents Introduction

A comic page with 4 panels in tech style (dark backgrounds, circuit patterns, neon accents).

## Panel 1 (Top, wide)
**Scene**: ADK-Bot stands before a holographic display showing three workflow patterns side by side: Sequential (straight arrow chain), Loop (circular arrow), Parallel (branching arrows that merge). Each is labeled and color-coded. Below them: "When agents should act without waiting for user input."
**Narration Box**: "Workflow Agents — Automated Agent Pipelines"
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "Parent agents wait for user input. Workflow agents pass control automatically between sub-agents!"
**Style**: Three workflow patterns as holographic diagrams, distinct colors per pattern

## Panel 2 (Middle-left)
**Scene**: Three scenario cards floating holographically: "Plan & Execute" (clipboard → robot), "Research & Write" (magnifying glass → pen), "Draft & Revise" (draft paper → polished paper). Each card shows a before and after with an arrow.
**Speech Bubble (Dev)**: "So workflow agents are for when you need agents to collaborate without human intervention!"
**Style**: Three scenario cards, before/after icons, clean layout

## Panel 3 (Middle-right)
**Scene**: ADK-Bot unveils the Movie Pitch System concept — a movie clapperboard labeled "MOVIE PITCH GENERATOR". Small icons show what it will do: research historical figures, write plot outlines, critique and iterate, predict box office, suggest casting.
**Narration Box**: "The Movie Pitch System"
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "We'll build a multi-agent system that creates movie pitches for biographical films!"
**Style**: Movie clapperboard, small task icons, dramatic reveal

## Panel 4 (Bottom, wide)
**Scene**: The complete final architecture diagram from the README shown as a holographic flow: greeter → SequentialAgent (film_concept_team) containing LoopAgent (writers_room with researcher → screenwriter → critic) → ParallelAgent (preproduction_team with box_office + casting) → file_writer. Each agent is a small character icon in its node.
**Narration Box**: "The Final Architecture"
**Speech Bubble (Dev)**: "We'll build this step by step — starting with Sequential!"
**Style**: Full architecture flow diagram, character icons in nodes, color-coded agent types
