# Page 3 - LoopAgent & ParallelAgent: Iterate and Fan Out

A comic page with 4 panels in tech style (dark backgrounds, circuit patterns, neon accents).

## Panel 1 (Top-left)
**Scene**: A circular conveyor loop glows in the center — Researcher-Bot, Writer-Bot, and Critic-Bot are positioned around it. Critic-Bot's traffic light head shows RED (iterate). Arrows show the flow: researcher -> screenwriter -> critic -> back to researcher. A counter in the corner shows "Iteration 2/5". The loop pulses with energy.
**Narration Box**: "Task 5: LoopAgent — Refine Until Perfect"
**Speech Bubble (Critic-Bot)**: "The plot needs more historical detail. Loop again!"
**Caption**: "max_iterations=5 | tools=[exit_loop]"
**Style**: Circular loop diagram, iteration counter, red/green traffic signals

## Panel 2 (Top-right)
**Scene**: Same loop, but now Critic-Bot's traffic light shows GREEN. The critic calls exit_loop and the loop breaks open — a glowing screenplay bursts out of the loop toward the next stage. The screenplay is now richer and more detailed with golden sparkles indicating quality.
**Speech Bubble (Critic-Bot)**: "Three-act structure achieved. Exit the loop!"
**Speech Bubble (Dev)**: "It keeps improving until the critic is satisfied!"
**Style**: Loop breaking open, green light, quality sparkles on output

## Panel 3 (Bottom-left)
**Scene**: Two agents — Box-Office-Bot (wearing a visor with stock-ticker numbers) and Casting-Bot (holding headshot photos of actors) — work simultaneously on separate holographic workstations. A "ParallelAgent" banner connects them. Dual progress bars show both running at the same time. Lightning bolts indicate speed.
**Narration Box**: "Task 6: ParallelAgent — Fan Out & Gather"
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "Independent tasks? Run them in parallel for speed!"
**Caption**: "preproduction_team = ParallelAgent(sub_agents=[box_office_researcher, casting_agent])"
**Style**: Split parallel workstations, dual progress bars, speed effects

## Panel 4 (Bottom-right, wide)
**Scene**: The complete system diagram is shown as a beautiful holographic architecture. The greeter at top flows into the film_concept_team SequentialAgent, which contains the writers_room LoopAgent (with researcher, screenwriter, critic inside a loop), then the preproduction_team ParallelAgent (box_office and casting side-by-side), and finally the file_writer. Dev and ADK-Bot admire the full system like architects viewing a blueprint.
**Speech Bubble (Dev)**: "Sequential, Loop, Parallel — combined into one powerful system!"
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "And if you need custom logic, there's CustomAgent too. The possibilities are endless!"
**Style**: Full architecture diagram, blueprint aesthetic, all workflow types visible, triumphant pose
