# Page 2 - The Hierarchical Agent Tree

A comic page with 4 panels in tech style (dark backgrounds, circuit patterns, neon accents).

## Panel 1 (Top, wide)
**Scene**: ADK-Bot projects a massive holographic tree diagram. At the top: root_agent (glowing gold). Below it, two branches: sub_agent1 and sub_agent2. Each sub-agent has its own sub-agents below, forming a tree. Arrows flow downward showing delegation paths. The tree mirrors a real-world org chart.
**Narration Box**: "The Hierarchical Agent Tree"
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "It always starts with root_agent at the top — it delegates to sub-agents below!"
**Style**: Holographic org chart tree, gold root node, branches flowing down

## Panel 2 (Middle-left)
**Scene**: Close-up of the tree showing three benefits as callout bubbles: "Inspired by real-world teams" (people icon), "Intuitive for developers" (code icon), "Greater control over flow" (traffic signal icon). Each benefit points to the tree structure.
**Speech Bubble (Dev)**: "It's like a company org chart for AI agents!"
**Style**: Tree with callout bubbles, clean icons for each benefit

## Panel 3 (Middle-right)
**Scene**: Code view showing the sub_agents parameter. A parent agent definition with `sub_agents=[travel_brainstormer, attractions_planner]` is highlighted. Arrows show how adding this single line creates the parent-child relationship. Note: "No parent parameter needed on children!"
**Code Display**: 'sub_agents=[travel_brainstormer, attractions_planner]'
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "One line of code creates the relationship — just add sub_agents to the parent!"
**Style**: Code highlight, arrows showing relationship, annotation note

## Panel 4 (Bottom, wide)
**Scene**: The actual travel agent tree for this lab: The Director (root_agent named "steering") at top, with Travel-Sprite (travel_brainstormer) and Attractions-Sprite (attractions_planner) as sub-agents below. A speech bubble from the steering agent asks "Know where to go, or need help deciding?"
**Speech Bubble (The Director)**: "Know where you'd like to travel, or need help deciding?"
**Speech Bubble (Dev)**: "The steering agent routes to the right specialist!"
**Style**: Simple three-node tree, character icons, routing arrows
