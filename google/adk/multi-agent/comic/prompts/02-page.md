# Page 2 - SequentialAgent: The Assembly Line

A comic page with 4 panels in tech style (dark backgrounds, circuit patterns, neon accents).

## Panel 1 (Top, wide)
**Scene**: ADK-Bot unveils a massive holographic assembly line. Three agent stations are connected by a glowing conveyor belt: Researcher-Bot (with glasses, holding a Wikipedia orb) feeds into Writer-Bot (holding a cyan quill) which feeds into a File-Writer-Bot (holding a disk icon). A glowing banner above reads "SequentialAgent: film_concept_team". Dev stands beside ADK-Bot watching the assembly line in action.
**Narration Box**: "Task 4: SequentialAgent — One After Another"
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "A SequentialAgent runs sub-agents in order. Output from one becomes input for the next!"
**Style**: Assembly line metaphor, left-to-right flow, conveyor belt glow

## Panel 2 (Middle-left)
**Scene**: Close-up of Researcher-Bot at its station. It holds a glowing Wikipedia orb and multiple holographic article pages float around it. Research notes stream out as glowing text flowing to the right along the conveyor belt. A small terminal shows the Wikipedia tool being called multiple times.
**Speech Bubble (Researcher-Bot)**: "I'll research Ada Lovelace — one query at a time until I have enough!"
**Caption**: "tools=[wikipedia_tool]"
**Style**: Research station, multiple tool calls, data streaming

## Panel 3 (Middle-right)
**Scene**: Writer-Bot catches the research data at its station and transforms it into a screenplay outline. Glowing pages materialize as it writes. The outline floats as a beautiful holographic scroll labeled "PLOT_OUTLINE". An output_key tag glows beneath: output_key="PLOT_OUTLINE".
**Speech Bubble (Writer-Bot)**: "From research to screenplay — the plot outline is born!"
**Style**: Creative transformation, screenplay scroll, purple creative energy

## Panel 4 (Bottom, wide)
**Scene**: File-Writer-Bot at the end of the line catches the finished screenplay and writes it to a glowing file icon labeled "Ada_Lovelace_Film.txt". The file materializes in the movie_pitches directory shown as a holographic folder. Dev reads the final output on a floating screen, impressed.
**Speech Bubble (Dev)**: "The whole pipeline ran automatically — no user input needed between agents!"
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "That's the power of workflow agents. No waiting for turns!"
**Style**: File creation effect, completion glow, satisfied Dev
