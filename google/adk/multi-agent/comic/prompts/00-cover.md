Generate a tech-style comic book cover page.

## Scene Description
A dramatic cover showing ADK-Bot (a friendly humanoid robot in Google blue/green/yellow/red colors with "ADK" on its chest, wearing a lab coat with circuit patterns) standing at the center of a swirling vortex of interconnected agent nodes. Around it, three stylized mini-robots — Researcher-Bot (with glasses and a glowing Wikipedia orb), Writer-Bot (with a floating cyan quill pen), and Critic-Bot (with a magnifying glass eye) — orbit in formation, connected by flowing neon energy arcs. Dev (young developer in hoodie, glasses) watches from below, amazed. Behind them, a massive holographic tree diagram shows the hierarchical agent structure branching outward. Floating screenplay pages swirl in the background like a cinematic storm.
