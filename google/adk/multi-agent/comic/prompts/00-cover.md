Generate a tech-style comic book cover page.

## Scene Description
A dramatic cover showing ADK-Bot at the center of a massive holographic organizational chart of interconnected AI agents. Multiple specialized robot agents orbit around ADK-Bot in formation: Researcher-Bot (with magnifying glasses), Writer-Bot (with quill pen), and Critic-Bot (with monocle and red pen). They are connected by flowing energy arcs in cyan, green, and purple. Dev stands below looking up at this magnificent multi-agent constellation. In the background, three workflow patterns are subtly visible: a straight arrow (Sequential), a circular loop (Loop), and branching parallel lines (Parallel). The background is a dark digital space with node-and-edge graph patterns.
