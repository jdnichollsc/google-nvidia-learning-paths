# Page 1 - Why Multi-Agent Systems?

A comic page with 4 panels in tech style (dark backgrounds, circuit patterns, neon accents).

## Panel 1 (Top, wide)
**Scene**: A single overwhelmed robot tries to juggle too many tasks at once — research, writing, fact-checking, planning, file management. Papers fly everywhere, sparks shoot from its overloaded circuits. It's clearly failing. Dev watches with concern.
**Speech Bubble (Dev)**: "One agent doing everything? That's a recipe for disaster!"
**Style**: Chaotic scene, overwhelmed robot, flying papers, sparking circuits

## Panel 2 (Middle-left)
**Scene**: ADK-Bot waves a hand and the chaotic scene transforms. The single robot splits into five specialized agents, each calmly handling one task. They're organized in a neat hierarchy with connecting lines.
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "Instead, divide the work! Each agent gets a specific job and set of skills."
**Style**: Transformation effect, order from chaos, organized hierarchy

## Panel 3 (Middle-right)
**Scene**: A holographic infographic showing the five advantages of multi-agent systems as glowing cards: "Easier to Design" (puzzle piece icon), "Specialized & Reliable" (target icon), "Organized" (folder icon), "Improvable" (wrench icon), "Modular" (building blocks icon).
**Narration Box**: "Multi-Agent Advantages"
**Style**: Five glowing advantage cards, clean icons, organized layout

## Panel 4 (Bottom, wide)
**Scene**: ADK-Bot reveals the lab objectives as a mission board with four key goals: 1) Create parent/sub-agent relationships 2) Use session state across agents 3) Read state values in instructions 4) Use workflow agents (Sequential, Loop, Parallel). Each objective has an icon.
**Narration Box**: "Your Mission in This Lab"
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "You'll master four orchestration techniques — let's start with the agent tree!"
**Style**: Mission board with four objective cards, checkbox icons
