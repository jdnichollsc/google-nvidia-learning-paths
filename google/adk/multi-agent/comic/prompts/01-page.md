# Page 1 - The Power of Many: Agent Hierarchies & Transfers

A comic page with 4 panels in tech style (dark backgrounds, circuit patterns, neon accents).

## Panel 1 (Top-left, wide)
**Scene**: Dev sits in the AI lab staring at a single glowing agent node on a holographic screen. The node is overwhelmed — sparks fly, error symbols pop around it. ADK-Bot walks in and gestures toward a new holographic display showing a tree of connected agents.
**Speech Bubble (Dev)**: "My single agent keeps failing on complex tasks..."
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "One agent doing everything? Let's divide and conquer with a multi-agent system!"
**Style**: Dark lab, single stressed node vs. elegant tree diagram

## Panel 2 (Top-right)
**Scene**: A beautiful holographic tree diagram materializes. The root_agent node (labeled "steering") glows at the top, with two branches leading to "travel_brainstormer" and "attractions_planner" sub-agent nodes. Arrows show the flow of transfers between them. The tree structure mirrors a real org chart.
**Narration Box**: "Task 2: The Hierarchical Agent Tree"
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "The root_agent sits at the top. It reads each sub-agent's description and decides who gets the task!"
**Style**: Glowing tree diagram, neon connections, org-chart feel

## Panel 3 (Bottom-left)
**Scene**: A split conversation view. On the left, a user says "I'd like to go to Japan." An arrow labeled "transfer" arcs from the steering agent to the attractions_planner agent. On the right, the user says "Actually, I don't know where to go" and an arrow arcs to travel_brainstormer. Peer transfer arrows connect the two sub-agents.
**Speech Bubble (Dev)**: "They can even transfer to peer agents!"
**Caption**: "sub_agents=[travel_brainstormer, attractions_planner]"
**Style**: Chat bubbles with glowing transfer arrows, split composition

## Panel 4 (Bottom-right)
**Scene**: Close-up of the attractions_planner agent node. A glowing dictionary labeled "Session State" floats beside it, showing key-value pairs: attractions: ["Sphinx", "Pyramids"]. A tool function save_attractions_to_state writes a new entry into the dictionary with sparkle effects. The key template { attractions? } appears as a glowing tag.
**Narration Box**: "Task 3: Session State"
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "Tools can write to session state, and agents read it with key templates like { attractions? }!"
**Style**: Dictionary visualization, golden data flow, state management concept
