# Page 2 - The Scenario: Cymbal Stadiums

A comic page with 4 panels in tech style (dark backgrounds, circuit patterns, neon accents).

## Panel 1 (Top, wide)
**Scene**: A futuristic stadium building with the "Cymbal Stadiums" logo. Multiple team bubbles surround it: Marketing Team, HR Team, Operations Team. Each team wants to use the same illustration agent, but copying code to each team creates maintenance nightmares shown as tangled wires.
**Narration Box**: "The Scenario: One Agent, Many Teams"
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "Cymbal Stadiums has an image generation agent — and every team wants it!"
**Style**: Stadium building, team bubbles, tangled wires showing code duplication problem

## Panel 2 (Middle-left)
**Scene**: The "wrong way" — multiple copies of the same agent code in different team folders. Each copy drifts apart (different versions shown as slightly different colored robots). A red X marks this approach.
**Speech Bubble (Dev)**: "Copying the code everywhere? That's impossible to maintain!"
**Style**: Multiple diverging copies, red X, maintenance nightmare visual

## Panel 3 (Middle-right)
**Scene**: The "right way" — Art-Agent deployed once on a cloud server, with multiple teams connecting to it remotely via A2A bridges. A green checkmark marks this approach. Single source of truth.
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "Deploy once, use everywhere — that's the A2A way!"
**Style**: Single central agent, multiple remote connections, green checkmark

## Panel 4 (Bottom, wide)
**Scene**: The architecture overview for the lab: Art-Agent (illustration_agent) deployed on Cloud Run on the right, Slide-Agent (slide_content_agent) running locally on the left. An A2A bridge connects them. Card-Sprite floats between, enabling discovery.
**Narration Box**: "The Architecture"
**Speech Bubble (Dev)**: "Slide-Agent writes text, then calls Art-Agent remotely for illustrations!"
**Style**: Architecture diagram with two sides, A2A bridge in center
