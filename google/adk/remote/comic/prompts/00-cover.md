Generate a tech-style comic book cover page.

## Scene Description
A dramatic cover showing two worlds connected by a glowing bridge of light. On the left side, ADK-Bot stands with Dev in a familiar AI lab setting. On the right side, across a vast digital expanse representing the cloud, Art-Agent (an easel-shaped robot with a paintbrush arm, glowing in purple and green) floats in a Cloud Run container represented as a glowing server pod. Between them, a brilliant beam of JSON-RPC data streams flow — carrying messages, tasks, and generated images. A holographic Agent Card (Card-Sprite) floats in the center of the bridge, spinning and projecting the remote agent's capabilities. The A2A protocol symbol glows in the sky above like a constellation connecting the two sides.

## Text Elements
- Title: "CONNECT TO REMOTE AGENTS" (large, bold, glowing neon cyan)
- Subtitle: "ADK + Agent2Agent Protocol" (smaller, electric purple)
- Bottom: "Deploy. Discover. Collaborate." (white)

## Style
Tech style: deep blue #1A365D background with a gradient split — left side warmer (lab environment) and right side cooler (cloud environment). Cyan #00D4FF and neon green #00FF88 glowing elements, electric purple #805AD5 accents for the A2A connection bridge. Circuit patterns, futuristic digital aesthetic. High contrast, dramatic lighting emanating from the A2A bridge in the center.
