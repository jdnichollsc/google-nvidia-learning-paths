## Scene Description
A dramatic cover showing two worlds connected by a luminous bridge of light representing the A2A protocol. On the left side, ADK-Bot and Dev stand in their local development lab with holographic screens. On the right side, Art-Agent (an easel-shaped robot in purple and green) works inside a Cloud Run server rack. Between them, Card-Sprite (a holographic JSON Agent Card) floats in the center, projecting capability descriptions to both sides. Energy beams flow across the A2A bridge carrying messages in both directions. The background shows a dark digital space with network topology patterns and the "A2A" letters glowing prominently.
