# Page 4 - Task 3: The Agent Card — Your Agent's Identity

A comic page with 4 panels in tech style (dark backgrounds, circuit patterns, neon accents).

## Panel 1 (Top, wide)
**Scene**: Card-Sprite dramatically materializes as a large holographic JSON document. It's styled like a futuristic ID badge or passport. Key fields glow with labels: "name" (name tag), "description" (scroll), "skills" (toolbox), "url" (link), "version" (badge). ADK-Bot presents it like an important artifact.
**Narration Box**: "Task 3: Create the Agent Card"
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "The Agent Card is your agent's identity — it tells the world what it can do!"
**Style**: Holographic ID badge/passport, labeled fields, dramatic reveal

## Panel 2 (Middle-left)
**Scene**: Close-up of the agent.json file content floating as organized cards. The "skills" array is expanded showing: id="illustrate_text", name="Illustrate Text", description, tags=["illustration", "image generation"]. Each skill is a card with an icon.
**Code Display**: '"skills": [{ "id": "illustrate_text", "name": "Illustrate Text" }]'
**Speech Bubble (Dev)**: "Skills describe what the agent can do — other agents read this to know when to call it!"
**Style**: JSON cards layout, skills expanded, tag badges

## Panel 3 (Middle-right)
**Scene**: The "url" field highlighted in the Agent Card, showing the Cloud Run URL pattern: https://illustration-agent-PROJECT.REGION.run.app/a2a/illustration_agent. An arrow from this URL extends into the cloud, pointing to where the agent will live.
**Code Display**: '"url": "https://illustration-agent-....run.app/a2a/illustration_agent"'
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "The URL tells callers exactly where to find your agent once deployed!"
**Style**: URL highlighted, arrow into cloud, deployment target

## Panel 4 (Bottom, wide)
**Scene**: The inputModes and outputModes fields shown as a communication contract. Input side: "text/plain" (text flowing in). Output side: "application/json" (JSON crystal flowing out). Like a handshake agreement between agents about what format to use.
**Narration Box**: "Communication Contract"
**Speech Bubble (Dev)**: "Input and output modes define the contract — text in, JSON out!"
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "Other agents know exactly what to send and what to expect back."
**Style**: Contract/handshake metaphor, text input and JSON output icons
