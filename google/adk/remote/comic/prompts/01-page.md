# Page 1 - The A2A Vision & The Illustration Agent

A comic page with 4 panels in tech style (dark backgrounds, circuit patterns, neon accents).

## Panel 1 (Top-left, wide)
**Scene**: Dev stands in a room with multiple holographic screens showing different AI frameworks — LangGraph, CrewAI, ADK — each in its own bubble. The agents inside can't communicate across bubbles. Dev looks frustrated. ADK-Bot enters with a glowing key labeled "A2A".
**Speech Bubble (Dev)**: "My agents are built on different frameworks. They can't talk to each other!"
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "That's exactly what the Agent2Agent protocol solves — a common language for all agents!"
**Style**: Isolated framework bubbles, frustration, then hope with A2A key

## Panel 2 (Top-right)
**Scene**: A holographic infographic shows the five A2A pillars as glowing icons stacked vertically: a JSON document (Standardized Communication), a business card (Agent Discovery), a data cube (Rich Data Exchange), three arrows — sync/stream/async (Flexible Interaction), and a shield (Enterprise-Ready). Each icon glows with a different accent color.
**Narration Box**: "The A2A Protocol: Core Concepts"
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTPS. Agents discover each other through Agent Cards!"
**Style**: Clean infographic, five glowing icons, educational layout

## Panel 3 (Bottom-left)
**Scene**: Art-Agent (the easel robot) is shown in its natural habitat — a creative studio inside a holographic frame. It holds its paintbrush arm over a canvas, generating a Corporate Memphis-style illustration of stadium workers. The colors are distinctly purple and green (Cymbal Stadiums brand). A label reads "illustration_agent" and small text shows the instruction highlights: "Corporate Memphis style, purple/green palette, stadium imagery."
**Narration Box**: "Task 2: The Illustration Agent"
**Speech Bubble (Art-Agent)**: "Give me text, and I'll create branded illustrations for Cymbal Stadiums!"
**Style**: Creative studio, Corporate Memphis samples, brand colors prominent

## Panel 4 (Bottom-right)
**Scene**: Close-up of Art-Agent's internal process shown as a two-step pipeline: Step 1 shows a text prompt flowing into a Gemini model icon that outputs raw image bytes (shown as a stream of colorful pixels). Step 2 shows those bytes being uploaded to a Cloud Storage bucket icon (a blue bucket with the GCS logo). A URL emerges from the bucket as a glowing link.
**Speech Bubble (Dev)**: "It generates the image with Gemini, then uploads to Cloud Storage!"
**Caption**: "generate_image() -> GCS bucket -> image URL"
**Style**: Pipeline visualization, two clear steps, data flow arrows
