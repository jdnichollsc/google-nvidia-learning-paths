# Page 1 - The Problem: Isolated AI Agents

A comic page with 4 panels in tech style (dark backgrounds, circuit patterns, neon accents).

## Panel 1 (Top, wide)
**Scene**: Multiple AI agents trapped in separate glass bubbles, each labeled with a different framework: "ADK", "LangGraph", "CrewAI", "Custom". They try to reach each other but their bubbles block communication. Thought bubbles show "I can't talk to them!" and "Different protocols!"
**Narration Box**: "The Challenge: AI Agents Can't Talk to Each Other"
**Speech Bubble (Dev)**: "Every framework speaks a different language — agents are isolated!"
**Style**: Glass bubble isolation, frustrated agents, broken communication lines

## Panel 2 (Middle-left)
**Scene**: ADK-Bot shatters the glass bubbles with a beam of light labeled "A2A Protocol". The agents are freed and start connecting through glowing bridges. The A2A logo appears prominently.
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "The Agent2Agent protocol gives agents a common language!"
**Style**: Dramatic bubble-shattering, liberation effect, A2A bridges forming

## Panel 3 (Middle-right)
**Scene**: A holographic infographic showing the five A2A core concepts as pillars: "Standardized Communication" (JSON-RPC icon), "Agent Discovery" (magnifying glass), "Rich Data Exchange" (file icons), "Flexible Interaction" (arrows: sync, stream, async), "Enterprise-Ready" (shield icon).
**Narration Box**: "A2A Core Concepts"
**Style**: Five pillars infographic, clean icons, balanced layout

## Panel 4 (Bottom, wide)
**Scene**: ADK-Bot presents the three lab objectives as mission cards: 1) "Deploy an ADK agent as an A2A Server" (rocket icon), 2) "Create a JSON Agent Card" (ID badge icon), 3) "Connect another agent remotely" (link chain icon). Dev looks excited.
**Narration Box**: "Your Mission"
**Speech Bubble (Dev)**: "We're going to make agents work across servers and frameworks!"
**Style**: Three mission cards with icons, organized layout
