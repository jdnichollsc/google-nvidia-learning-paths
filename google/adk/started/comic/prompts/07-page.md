# Page 7 - Task 4: Running Programmatically with Structured Output

A comic page with 4 panels in tech style (dark backgrounds, circuit patterns, neon accents).

## Panel 1 (Top-left)
**Scene**: Dev switches from the browser to a Python code editor. ADK-Bot explains the key components floating as holographic building blocks: InMemoryRunner (a running figure icon), SessionService (a memory chip icon), Content/Part (message envelope icons).
**Narration Box**: "Task 4: Run Agents Programmatically"
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "Three building blocks: Runner executes, SessionService remembers, Content carries messages!"
**Style**: Building block icons floating, connected by dotted lines

## Panel 2 (Top-right)
**Scene**: Code editor showing the Python script. The key lines are highlighted: creating a runner with InMemoryRunner, creating a session, and sending a message with types.Content() and types.Part(). Each highlighted line has a small annotation arrow.
**Code Display**: "runner = InMemoryRunner(agent=root_agent)"
**Code Display**: "session = await session_service.create_session()"
**Speech Bubble (Dev)**: "Now I can integrate agents into any Python application!"
**Style**: Code with highlighted lines, annotation arrows pointing to key concepts

## Panel 3 (Bottom-left)
**Scene**: ADK-Bot holds up a crystal-shaped Pydantic model labeled "CountryCapital" with two fields visible: "country" and "capital". The crystal transforms raw text into clean structured JSON. Messy text particles enter from the left, clean JSON exits from the right.
**Narration Box**: "Structured Output with Pydantic"
**Code Display**: "output_schema=CountryCapital"
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "Define a Pydantic BaseModel and the agent outputs perfectly structured JSON!"
**Style**: Crystal/prism transformation, messy input → clean JSON output

## Panel 4 (Bottom-right)
**Scene**: The output appears as a floating holographic JSON object: {"country": "France", "capital": "Paris"}. Dev catches it like a glowing data package. Each field is color-coded: keys in cyan, values in neon green.
**Output Display**: '{"country": "France", "capital": "Paris"}'
**Speech Bubble (Dev)**: "Clean, predictable data — perfect for building real applications!"
**Style**: Holographic JSON, color-coded fields, glowing data package
