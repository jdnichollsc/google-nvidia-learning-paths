# Page 4 - Task 1: Install ADK & Environment Setup

A comic page with 4 panels in tech style (dark backgrounds, circuit patterns, neon accents).

## Panel 1 (Top-left)
**Scene**: Dev sits at Cloud Shell Terminal. ADK-Bot points at the screen showing the Vertex AI API being enabled — a holographic shield with "Vertex AI" text activates with a green checkmark glow.
**Narration Box**: "Task 1: Install ADK & Set Up"
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "First, enable the Vertex AI API — it powers your agent's brain!"
**Style**: Shield activation effect, green glow, API icon

## Panel 2 (Top-right)
**Scene**: Terminal screen close-up showing the pip install command with a progress bar filling up. Green text flows across the screen. Small package icons (google-adk) download and snap into place like puzzle pieces.
**Terminal Text**: "$ pip install google-adk"
**Terminal Text**: "Successfully installed google-adk ✓"
**Speech Bubble (Dev)**: "One command and we're ready!"
**Style**: Terminal with green progress bar, package puzzle pieces snapping together

## Panel 3 (Bottom-left)
**Scene**: ADK-Bot opens a holographic .env file showing environment variables floating as labeled key-value cards: GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=TRUE, GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT, GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION. Each card has a small lock icon.
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "The .env file holds your project credentials — it tells ADK where to find Vertex AI."
**Style**: Floating config cards with lock icons, secure green borders

## Panel 4 (Bottom-right)
**Scene**: Dev types in terminal with confident expression. The PATH environment variable is visualized as a glowing road extending into the distance, with a new ADK path segment being added to it.
**Terminal Text**: "$ export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin"
**Speech Bubble (Dev)**: "Path updated — ADK commands are now accessible everywhere!"
**Style**: Road/path metaphor, extending golden road with new segment glowing
