# Page 6 - Task 3: Running with the Dev UI

A comic page with 4 panels in tech style (dark backgrounds, circuit patterns, neon accents).

## Panel 1 (Top, wide)
**Scene**: Dev types `adk web` in the terminal and a massive holographic browser window materializes in front of them like a command center activating. The ADK Dev UI shows a sidebar with agent names, a chat area, and trace panels. ADK-Bot stands beside it proudly.
**Narration Box**: "Task 3: Launch the Dev UI"
**Terminal Text**: "$ adk web"
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "Your testing dashboard — chat with your agent and inspect every detail!"
**Style**: Command center activation, big holographic browser, dramatic lighting

## Panel 2 (Middle-left)
**Scene**: Close-up of the Dev UI chat. Dev types "What's the latest news about AI?" and the agent responds with a well-formatted answer. Glowing citation links appear as floating source badges next to the response. The Search-Sprite orb orbits the response.
**Speech Bubble (Dev)**: "It cites its sources — that's the Google Search grounding!"
**Style**: Chat interface, glowing source citation badges, Search-Sprite sparkles

## Panel 3 (Middle-right)
**Scene**: Dev clicks on an event in the sidebar. A trace panel expands showing the full execution flow: User Message → Agent Processing → Tool Call (google_search) → Search Results → Final Response. Each step is a node connected by glowing arrows.
**Narration Box**: "Tracing & Debugging"
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "Click any event to see exactly what happened — the model's reasoning, tool calls, everything!"
**Style**: Execution trace flowchart, nodes and arrows, debug inspector view

## Panel 4 (Bottom, wide)
**Scene**: Split view showing two experiments side by side. On the left, a session with a search query. On the right, a new session with a different query. Dev switches between them using tabs at the top. A "New Session" button glows in the upper right.
**Speech Bubble (Dev)**: "I can run multiple sessions to test different scenarios!"
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "Each session maintains its own conversation history and state."
**Style**: Split panel with two chat sessions, tab navigation, comparison view
