# Page 2 - Dev UI & Testing

A comic page with 4 panels in tech style (dark backgrounds, circuit patterns, neon accents).

## Panel 1 (Top, wide)
**Scene**: A large holographic browser window shows the ADK Dev UI — a dark interface with a sidebar showing agent names, and a chat area. Dev and ADK-Bot stand before it like a command center.
**Narration Box**: "Task 3: Launch the Dev UI"
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "Run 'adk web' and your testing dashboard appears!"
**Style**: Big holographic screen, Dev UI mockup, command-center feel

## Panel 2 (Middle-left)
**Scene**: Close-up of the chat in the Dev UI. The user message says "What's the latest news?" and the agent reply shows grounded search results with source links glowing.
**Speech Bubble (Dev)**: "It searches the web and gives grounded answers!"
**Style**: Chat interface, glowing source citations

## Panel 3 (Middle-right)
**Scene**: Dev is now at a Python code editor. The code shows output_schema=CountryCapital and the output {"capital": "Paris"} floats out as a clean JSON crystal.
**Narration Box**: "Task 4: Programmatic + Structured Output"
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "Add a Pydantic schema and your agent outputs clean JSON!"
**Style**: Code glowing, JSON as a geometric crystal

## Panel 4 (Bottom, wide)
**Scene**: Split view — on the left, Dev types in a terminal (CLI chat with 'adk run'). On the right, two agents work together: a detective-styled critic_agent examines facts, passing to a writer-styled reviser_agent who corrects them. A banner reads "Multi-Agent Power!"
**Narration Box**: "Tasks 5-6: CLI Chat & Multi-Agent Systems"
**Speech Bubble (Dev)**: "Agents that fact-check each other — the llm_auditor is amazing!"
**Thought Bubble**: "SequentialAgent chains critic → reviser"
**Style**: Split panel, two agents collaborating, energy flowing between them
