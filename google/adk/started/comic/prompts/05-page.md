# Page 5 - Task 2: Project Structure & Agent Anatomy

A comic page with 4 panels in tech style (dark backgrounds, circuit patterns, neon accents).

## Panel 1 (Top, wide)
**Scene**: ADK-Bot reveals a massive holographic file tree, showing the agent folder structure. The root folder glows, with three files floating inside: __init__.py (blue card), agent.py (green card), and .env (yellow card). Arrows connect them showing how they relate.
**Narration Box**: "Task 2: Review the Project Structure"
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "Every ADK agent lives in its own folder — simple and organized!"
**Style**: 3D holographic file tree, glowing cards for each file, connection arrows

## Panel 2 (Middle-left)
**Scene**: Close-up of the __init__.py file card expanding to show its code. The import statement `from . import agent` is highlighted with a glowing arrow pointing to agent.py. A small "entry point" sign hangs above it.
**Code Display**: "from . import agent"
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "The __init__.py is the entry point — it tells ADK where to find your agent definition."
**Style**: Code on dark background, highlighted import with connecting arrow

## Panel 3 (Middle-right)
**Scene**: The agent.py card expands into a blueprint showing the Agent() constructor with its parameters floating as labeled components: name (name tag), model (brain icon), description (scroll), instruction (compass), tools (toolbox). Dev studies it like an architect examining blueprints.
**Speech Bubble (Dev)**: "So agent.py is where I define who my agent is and what it can do!"
**Style**: Blueprint/schematic layout, labeled component icons

## Panel 4 (Bottom, wide)
**Scene**: Dev places the golden Search-Sprite orb into the tools parameter of the agent code. The Search-Sprite sparkles and connects to the agent with a golden energy tether. The code shows: tools=[google_search]. ADK-Bot watches approvingly.
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "Google Search gives your agent real-time information — grounding its responses in facts!"
**Speech Bubble (Dev)**: "My agent can now search the entire web!"
**Style**: Golden energy flowing from Search-Sprite into code, sparkle effects
