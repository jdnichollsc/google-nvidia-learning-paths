# Page 3 - The ADK Ecosystem

A comic page with 4 panels in tech style (dark backgrounds, circuit patterns, neon accents).

## Panel 1 (Top, wide)
**Scene**: ADK-Bot projects a massive holographic infographic showing ADK's position in the AI framework landscape. On the left: "Easy to Use" solutions (Agentspace, Conversational Agents). On the right: "Flexible" low-level tools (LangChain, GenKit, Custom). ADK sits perfectly balanced in the sweet spot between them, glowing brightly.
**Narration Box**: "Where ADK Fits"
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "ADK balances ease-of-use with full flexibility — the best of both worlds!"
**Style**: Holographic positioning chart, gradient from green (easy) to purple (flexible), ADK star glowing in center

## Panel 2 (Middle-left)
**Scene**: Six glowing pillars rise from the ground like a futuristic temple, each labeled with an ADK capability: "Multi-Agent Systems", "Rich Tool Ecosystem", "Flexible Orchestration", "Developer Experience", "Built-in Evaluation", "Deployment Ready". Dev walks between them in awe.
**Speech Bubble (Dev)**: "Six superpowers in one framework!"
**Style**: Monumental pillars with neon glow, each a different accent color

## Panel 3 (Middle-right)
**Scene**: Close-up of a holographic card showing the six objectives for this lab, styled as mission cards: 1) Create an agent with search tool 2) Test via browser UI 3) Test via CLI 4) Test programmatically 5) Control output schema 6) Preview multi-agent. Each card has a small icon.
**Narration Box**: "Your Mission"
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "By the end, you'll master all three ways to run an agent!"
**Style**: Floating mission cards with checkbox icons, neon borders

## Panel 4 (Bottom, wide)
**Scene**: Dev puts on a virtual reality headset. The scene transitions into a futuristic workspace — Cloud Shell Editor floating in space with terminal windows, file explorers, and code panels surrounding Dev in a 360-degree holographic workspace.
**Speech Bubble (Dev)**: "Cloud Shell Editor — my command center!"
**Narration Box**: "Setting Up the Workspace"
**Style**: VR transition effect, holographic IDE floating in dark space
