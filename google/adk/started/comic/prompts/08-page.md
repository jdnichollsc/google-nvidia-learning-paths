# Page 8 - Task 5: CLI Chat & Task 6: Multi-Agent Preview

A comic page with 4 panels in tech style (dark backgrounds, circuit patterns, neon accents).

## Panel 1 (Top-left)
**Scene**: Dev sits at a terminal running `adk run`. The CLI shows a `[user]:` prompt with a blinking cursor. Text exchanges scroll up showing a natural conversation between user and agent. The terminal has a retro-futuristic green-on-black look.
**Narration Box**: "Task 5: CLI Chat Interface"
**Terminal Text**: "$ adk run my_agent"
**Terminal Text**: "[user]: What can you tell me about Mars?"
**Terminal Text**: "[my_agent]: Mars is the fourth planet..."
**Speech Bubble (Dev)**: "Quick and direct — no browser needed!"
**Style**: Retro terminal, green text on black, chat conversation flowing

## Panel 2 (Top-right)
**Scene**: ADK-Bot presents a comparison of all three ways to run agents as a holographic triptych: Dev UI (browser icon), Programmatic (Python code icon), CLI (terminal icon). Each has pros listed below: "Visual debugging", "Integration ready", "Quick testing".
**Narration Box**: "Three Ways to Run"
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "Dev UI for debugging, programmatic for integration, CLI for quick tests!"
**Style**: Three columns comparison, icons and pros listed, balanced layout

## Panel 3 (Bottom-left)
**Scene**: A dramatic reveal — two new agents appear from portals on either side: a detective-styled critic_agent (with magnifying glass and deerstalker hat) on the left, and a writer-styled reviser_agent (with quill pen and scroll) on the right. They shake hands in the center.
**Narration Box**: "Task 6: Multi-Agent Preview — The LLM Auditor"
**Speech Bubble (Critic Agent)**: "I find the flaws..."
**Speech Bubble (Reviser Agent)**: "...and I fix them!"
**Style**: Dramatic character reveal, portal effects, stylized agent personas

## Panel 4 (Bottom, wide)
**Scene**: A SequentialAgent pipeline visualization: critic_agent passes a document (with red marks) through a glowing arrow to reviser_agent, who produces a polished version. The flow reads left to right with "SequentialAgent" labeled above. Dev and ADK-Bot watch from below.
**Speech Bubble (ADK-Bot)**: "SequentialAgent chains agents together — one's output feeds the next!"
**Speech Bubble (Dev)**: "Agents that fact-check each other — the future of reliable AI!"
**Narration Box**: "Next: Build full multi-agent systems →"
**Style**: Assembly line flow, document transformation, sequential arrows
